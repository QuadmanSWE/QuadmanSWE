## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an independent Platform Engineering Consultant - I keep the peace between humans and computers. To read more about me and what Iâ€™ve done in the past you should check out [my CV](https://blog.dsoderlund.consulting/cv/). There you can also find more ways to get in touch with me.
In the archive of [my site[(https://blog.dsoderlund.consulting/about) you can read stuff that I've written about things I found interesting at the time or that I thought I was going to have to remember later. Some of it is actually really cool or useful too :)
