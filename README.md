## About me

I am an independent Platform Engineering Consultant - I keep the peace between humans and computers. To read more about me and what I‚Äôve done in the past you should check out [CV](https://blog.dsoderlund.consulting/cv/). There you can also find more ways to üì´ get in touch with me.

In the archive of [my site](https://blog.dsoderlund.consulting/about) you can read stuff that I've written about things I found interesting at the time or that I thought I was going to have to remember later. Some of it is actually really cool or useful too :)


## üõ†Ô∏è Here are some of the stuff that I like to work on.

You can see a lot of those tools and systems in action together in [my repo "ds-ref-platform"](https://github.com/QuadmanSWE/ds-ref-platform) (short for David S√∂derlund's Reference Platform)

I also host a variant of it on top proxmox/talos if you want a live demo or run a workshop with some or all of the tools together with your ideas.
