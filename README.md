## Hi there 👋

I am an independent Platform Engineering Consultant - I keep the peace between humans and computers. To read more about me and what I’ve done in the past you should check out [my CV](https://blog.dsoderlund.consulting/cv/). There you can also find more ways to 📫 get in touch with me.

In the archive of [my site[(https://blog.dsoderlund.consulting/about) you can read stuff that I've written about things I found interesting at the time or that I thought I was going to have to remember later. Some of it is actually really cool or useful too :)

## 🛠️ Here are some of the stuff that I like to work on.

You can see a lot of those tools and systems in action together in my repo "ds-ref-platform" (David Söderlund Reference Platform)



I also host a variant of this on top proxmox/talos if you want a live demo.
